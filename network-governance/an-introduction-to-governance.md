# An Introduction to Governance

The governance functions of the Edge Network are open for anyone with an active $XE stake. This includes all node operators.

**Governance is not yet live. It is expected to launch soon**
{% endhint %}

Stake holders have the ability to both create and vote upon proposals. Proposal creation carries a cost in $XE and voting on proposals locks stakes for a fixed period of time. These measure are designed to keep the quality of the proposals high.

Proposals will require certain majorities in order to be passed. Stargates have a collective right to veto or to propose amendments to proposals.

**Governance is currently advisory, with the core dev team also holding the right to veto**

## Growth Fund

The growth fund in the network is a meaningful and growing allocation of $XE that is set aside for the advancement of the network. The growth fund can be used for items such as marketing, exchange listings and community rewards. The use of the growth fund is under the direct control of network governance.
