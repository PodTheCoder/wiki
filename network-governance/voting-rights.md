# Voting Rights

Participation in governance is open to for anyone with an active governance stake.

One governance stake can be made per wallet, and a single governance stake connotes the right to one vote on each proposal raised through the governance function. In addition to this, DAO members have a collective right to veto, and to propose amendments to proposals that can be sent back to governance for a further vote.
