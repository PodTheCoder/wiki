# Voting Rights

Participation in governance is open to for anyone with an active $XE stake. This includes all node operators.

One stake in the network connotes the right to one vote on each proposal raised through the governance function. In addition to this, Stargate holders have a collective right to veto, and to propose amendments to proposals that can be sent back to the entire community for a further vote.
