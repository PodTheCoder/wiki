# $XE Distribution

{% hint style="danger" %}
**$XE distribution closed at the end of September 2021**
{% endhint %}

A total of 50 million $XE were minted and distributed. In addition to this, 10 million $XE are locked in the network to be mined and released as node rewards.

Holders of the original $EDGE token who had been through the swap process to $TNC were able to claim a distribuion of $XE. This was proportional to their original holdings, factoring the reduction in supply.

In addition, a small percentage of all holders funds were held back to create the Growth Fund.

## Node Rewards

$XE has a mineable supply of 10 million coins, with a steady emissions curve tied to block time. Mined coins provide the yield for the network and are released as node rewards.

The maximum yield in year one is 1 million $XE (10%). This will be reduced in year two, further in year three and so on.

The following table shows expected emitted $XE for the next five years:

| Year    | Emitted $XE | Supply Increase |
| ------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| 2021/22 | 1,000,000   | 2.00%           |
| 2022/23 | 900,000     | 1.76%           |
| 2023/24 | 810,000     | 1.56%           |
| 2024/25 | 729,000     | 1.38%           |
| 2025/26 | 656,100     | 1.23%           |

Node rewards are held in a network-controlled wallet:
