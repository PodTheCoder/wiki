# $XE Distribution

{% hint style="danger" %}
**$XE distributed hasn't started. It is expected to start in June 2021**
{% endhint %}

A total of 50 million $XE will be minted and distributed. In addition to this, 10 million $XE are locked in the network to be mined and released as node rewards.

Holders of the original $EDGE token who have been through the swap process to TNC in Edge Console will be able to claim a distribution of $XE. This is proportional to their original holdings, factoring the reduction in supply.

In addition, a small percentage of all holders funds will be held back to create the Growth Fund.

## Distribution Break Out

The **Dev Fund** holds $XE assigned to support the day-to-day development of the network. The **Growth Fund** holds $XE assigned to support the marketing and growth in uptake of the Edge Network. The **Staking Contract** holds $XE locked in the network as governance and node stakes. The **Community** distribution are the $XE held by individual supporters and customers of the Edge Network.

**The figures below are projected initial distribution percentages for $XE**
{% endhint %}

| Distribution | Percentage Allocation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Dev Fund | 15.64% |
| Growth Fund | 10.25% |
| Staking Contract | 31.54% |
| Community Circulating | 34.57% |

The Growth Fund is controlled through project governance.

## Node Rewards

$XE has a mineable supply of 10 million coins, with a steady emissions curve tied to block time. Mined coins provide the yield for the network and are released as node rewards.

The maximum yield in year one is 1 million $XE \(10%\). This will be reduced in year two, further in year three and so on.

The following table shows expected emitted $XE for the next five years:

| Year | Emitted $XE | Supply Increase |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2021/22 | 1,000,000 | 2.00% |
| 2022/23 | 900,000 | 1.76% |
| 2023/24 | 810,000 | 1.56% |
| 2024/25 | 729,000 | 1.38% |
| 2025/26 | 656,100 | 1.23% |
