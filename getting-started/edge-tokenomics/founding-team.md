# Founding Team

The founding team allocation at crowdsale in 2018 was 20%. This was vested over five years. Three years of vested tokens have been released, in February 2018, February 2019 and February 2020.

The remaining allocation – 8% – has been swapped to $XE and a new vesting schedule has been put in place. This schedule runs over five years, releasing at 20% per year, meaning that a maximum of 1.6% of supply will be made available to the founding team per year.

The three original founders of Edge hold the largest portion of this distribution:

| Founder | Distribution | $XE Wallet Address |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Joseph Denne | 2.15% | TBC |
| Chris Mair | 2.15% | TBC |
| Will Lebens | 2.15% | TBC |
| Others | 1.54% | TBC |

The $XE wallet addresses used for vesting have been broken out and are published above inline with Edge's commitment to transparency.
