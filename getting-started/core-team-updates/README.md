Good evening everyone üëã

For those of you that are new to the community, we post weekly core team updates to our main channels, including to the wiki. These are on a Friday, at some point in the evening, depending on how busy we've been.

There have been 126 of these so far. You can see a full history here:

On to this week‚Äôs update‚Ä¶ \#127!

The $XE‚Äì$EDGE bridge in the Ethereum network opened yesterday evening and is working well. This is the first bridge for the network, with more planned for next year.

You can see a how-to for the bridge here:

$EDGE was listed on Uniswap! You can access the pairing here:

Gas fees in the Ethereum network have been crazy high of late, and we are aware of the barrier that these may represent to some of the community. To help with this we are adding a ‚ÄúSell‚Äù option directly into the XE Web Wallet. This places OTC directly within the wallet and will allow you to sell your holdings directly for USDC where buy-side demand is available.

The sell option will still carry gas fees, but as these are for a single low-speed transaction outside of a contract, they will be far lower than those associated with bridging out and market trading on Uniswap.

I have Chris and Adam with me this evening. Chris wants to update you on our plans for outreach.

Evening all

Edge 2.0 has gotten off to a good start. Thanks again to all the community for bearing with us over the past months. Appreciate things have been frustrating at times, but we got there in the end and now the new era of Edge awaits. We want to do things differently this time round, with a primary focus on developing the network both in terms of capacity and usage.

To this end we want as much community involvement as possible such as ideas, introductions, collaborations etc.

We have allocated a proportion of treasury funds to reward involvement when appropriate. We want to foster a culture here that will positively advance the network in the long term.

If you have any thoughts on ways we could do that then please join the conversation in the \#buidl channel in Discord.

Thanks again for your ongoing support.

Thank you Chris!

We‚Äôre aware that a few members of the community seem to have missed the distribution window for XE. There was over a year of notice on the re-release of the Edge token, and a three month distribution window. However we are currently discussing how we could extend the window for a short period. We‚Äôll update you on this front in the coming days.

Now o nto Adam for an update on this week‚Äôs releases.

Thanks Joe. Evening all!

Wallet v1.5.2 was released. Along with the features and fixes we released in v1.3 last week, further updates were delivered ahead of the Bridge opening in v1.4, including but not limited to being able to use commas in transaction amounts, and then of course v1.5 included the Bridge functionality and a few small cosmetic fixes.

Explorer v1.2.4 released also, with a short but sweet update to some of the static content and some internal optimisations. We have more updates planned for the explorer including the ability to view wallets, stakes, network nodes, and token stats.

Index v1.5.0 was released, which saw some minor changes to the gas rates endpoint, previously known simply as rates, but now referred to as gas rates.

Bridge v1.2.5 released, which brought a number of improvements including optimisations to transaction processing.

The XE blockchain itself was even part of the release party, with v1.2.1 released which saw a few tweaks to how transactions are processed. Both v1.2.0 and v1.2.1 were deployed to mainnet yesterday evening and the updates were seamless.

In addition to the above releases, this week also saw two libraries updated, both bridge-utils and wallet-utils were converted to TypeScript and released.

Through streamlining our development processes and focusing on unifying our technology stack, we‚Äôve been able to develop and release services and updates at a quicker pace than ever before. This year has seen the release of the Edge Services portal, the XE Blockchain network, as well as Wallet, Explorer, Index, and now Bridge too. And there‚Äôs more to come, including v2 of the network services including Stargate, Gateway, and Host, as well as the new `edge` CLI which will be completely wallet based, allowing you to manage your wallet \(including staking and device onboarding\) directly from the command line.

We‚Äôre also working on the mobile Wallet app for both iOS and Android, which we‚Äôve talked about before and shared the UX designs for. Meanwhile, the network mainnet has remained operational throughout, handling over 100‚Äôs of millions of requests and 10‚Äôs of TB of data for customers, and has itself received a number of updates over the year.

This may seem like an end of year report \(!\), but we‚Äôve still got three months left and we‚Äôre planning to cram it full of updates as we continue to hit roadmap targets. And, speaking of roadmaps, we‚Äôll be sharing an updated public roadmap with you in the next couple of weeks.

Thanks Adam!

And that‚Äôs it for now ‚Äì have a great weekend, and see you next week.

This weekend, why not help spread the word? The more the existing community helps to promote and drive the project forward, the stronger we will become.

For the very latest from Edge, join our Discord server: [ed.ge/discord](https://ed.ge/discord)

Enjoy your weekends.
