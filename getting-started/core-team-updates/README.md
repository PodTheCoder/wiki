## Latest Update

Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

This week has been focused on ongoing testing of the network bridge, with as-live hot wallets for both Edge and XE used. Testing is now complete. The next stage will be moving to a live footing, just ahead of release.

The contract for the $EDGE token in the Ethereum network was published and verified. Token information and the supporting logo will now be ported from the old contract.

Distribution of XE is ongoing, with the process continuing to run daily.

Compute testing within Edge environments continued. We are now running production traffic from the first full setup aligned with the London Stargate. This will be broadened out over the coming weeks, with setups currently with third parties in plan to be moved into Edge compute.

Work is expected to begin on an API layer for the service soon. Once complete interfaces will be added into the services areas of the Edge Network site, which will allow for the launching and control of compute resources.

The team established a partnership with an agency in the Middle East, providing a foothold in the market for the provision of services. Weâ€™ve co-pitched already, and have a bunch of opportunities in motion.

I completely forgot to mention in last week's update that Monocle - running on Edge CDN and Edit tech, across desktop and mobile - was used in the Apple Keynote at WWDC â€˜21. Very cool.
