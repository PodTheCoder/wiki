The Edge Network is a completely unique technology stack, originated by the core team and developed over many years. It is predominantly written in Golang.

### Where Can I Find the Source Code for the Edge Network?

Edge's source code is currently partially open source, with plans for going fully open source in motion. You can access projects code repository on Github at: [github.com/edge](https://github.com/edge)
