# Community Leads

Edge has two full time community admins. They are flagged as **Community Managers** in Discord and as **Admins** in Telegram.

Senior members of the community are occasionally promoted to the role of community lead. Community leads are the step up to help other members of the community; help to maintain a posititve and welcoming environment; and keep themselves up to date on all things Edge.

If you would like to assist the project as a community lead, please reach out directly to a member of the core team. Your support in this area will be greatly appreciated.

**WARNING:** Do **NOT** accept help from somebody private messaging you claiming to be a member of the core team or a Community manager! This is a common scam technique designed to talk you into giving up information that can allow bad actors to steal your funds. **NEVER** give out wallet seed phrases! There is absolutely no reason for any member of the team to request this information.

If a team member sees a need to continue support in private, they will publicly ask **YOU** to message them first.
