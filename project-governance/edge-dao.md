# The Edge DAO

{% hint style="info" %}
**This section will be updated as additional definition is added to the DAO**
{% endhint %}

Edge is in the process of migrating to a full Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) â€“ a team of individuals organised around a set of guidelines and processes and dedicated to driving the Edge Network forward.

The DAO is a majority flat structure, comprising the original founders of the project, members of the core development team and members of the advisory board. The DAO has control over Edge Network Technologies Limited, the not for profit organisation that handles relationships with other legal entities, such as RIPE.

DAO participation will be opened up in time, allowing anyone to become a member. The mechanics of this remain under discussion and will be formalised in due course.
