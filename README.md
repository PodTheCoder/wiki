# Edge Community Wiki

Edge is the world's first dedicated edge network. A blockchain for edge computing, with a computational layer and a series of services on top. Edge makes use of the spare capacity all around us, meaning it's greener than the cloud, and faster too.

The Edge Community Wiki is intended as the go to resource for all things Edge. Here you can learn about the technologies behind the platform; find out how to contribute to the network; how to participate in project governance; read answers to common support questions; and browse network FAQ.
