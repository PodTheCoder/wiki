The core team would like to understand a little more about your appetite for custom Edge devices.

Weâ€™ve been pushing hard in this space, and are considering releasing one or more devices as ready-to-go nodes which could be purchased using $EDGE/$XE or other crypto currencies.

To help guide the future of custom devices for the Edge Network, please take a moment to complete this anonymous survey:
