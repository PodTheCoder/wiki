# Edge Community Wiki

Edge is the world's first dedicated edge network â€“ a blockchain dedicated to edge computing; a computational layer that makes use of the spare capacity all around us; and a series of services that run within it.

The Edge Community Wiki is intended as the go to resource for all things Edge. Here you can learn about the technologies behind the platform; find out how to contribute to the network; how to participate in project governance; read answers to common support questions; and browse network FAQ.
